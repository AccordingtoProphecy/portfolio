    <h2 class="title">Java Projects</h2>
    
    <div>
        <h3 class="project">Untitled Text-Based Role-Playing Game</h3>
            <p class="description">This is a small-ish project of mine that I am using to learn more
            about structuring Java and overall coding and hope to expand on. This 
            project is nowhere close to being done at the moment, but I hope to 
            continue it the more I learn about Java. This currently only runs in
            the terminal.</p>

    <div>
        <h3 class="project">Dieroll</h3>
            <p class="description">This is another small project that I hope to expand on in the future.
            It gives the user a prompt to choose between any of the most popular types
            of dice. At the moment, it only does one roll and only runs in the terminal,
            but in the future I hope to allow multiple die rolls and possibly visuals.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Python Projects</h2>

    <div>
        <h3 class="project">Python Web Scraper</h3>
            <p class="description">This is a larger project for school that is able to look for changes in text
            on a website with certain time intervals and inputs from the user. It is based
            on Henry McCreery's code and requires specific things to be done to work. More 
            information on the Github page.</p>
