        <h3>Untitled Text-Based Role-Playing Game</h3>
            <p>This is a small-ish project of mine that I am using to learn more
            about structuring Java and overall coding and hope to expand on. This 
            project is nowhere close to being done at the moment, but I hope to 
            continue it the more I learn about Java. This currently only runs in
            the terminal.</p>

    <div>
        <h3>Dieroll</h3>
            <p>This is another small project that I hope to expand on in the future.
            It gives the user a prompt to choose between any of the most popular types
            of dice. At the moment, it only does one roll and only runs in the terminal,
            but in the future I hope to allow multiple die rolls and possibly visuals.
